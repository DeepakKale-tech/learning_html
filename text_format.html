         <h3>History of Shaniwar Wada</h3>
         <hr>
         <p>The <strong>Shaniwar Wada</strong> was normally the seven-story capital building of the <em>Peshwas of the Maratha Empire</em>. It was supposed to be made entirely of stone. However, after the completion of the base floor or the first story, <mark>the people of Satara (the national capital)</mark> complained to the Chhatrapati Shahu I (Emperor) saying that a stone monument can be sanctioned and built only by the emperor himself and not the Peshwas. Following this, an official letter was written to the Peshwas stating that the remaining building had to be made of brick and not stone.</p>
         <p>By 1758, at least a thousand people lived in the fort.<b> In 1773, Narayanrao, who was the fifth and ruling Peshwa then,</b> was murdered by guards on orders of his uncle Raghunathrao and aunt Anandibai. <u>A popular legend has it that Narayanrao's ghost still calls for help on full moon nights.</u> Various people, working around the area, have allegedly reported the cries of "Kaka mala vachava" (Uncle, save me) by Narayanrao Peshwa after his death. <i>The book, Assassination of the Peshwa</i></p>
